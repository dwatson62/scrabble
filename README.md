## Synopsis

Making Scrabble in Angular. Because why not.

Version Scooter:

It is a one player game, players can place a word anywhere on the board and score points for a valid word, and 0 points for an invalid word.

To play, click on a letter, and then the tile where you wish to place it. Once you have placed your word, click "Play Word" to submit. If you change your mind, the "Clear" button will reset your selection. You can swap an unwanted letter by selecting it, and then clicking "Swap Letter".

Bonuses are not available yet, and words cannot intersect with each other just yet. Blank tiles are not in the game at the moment.

When the game runs low on letters, the console merely says game over.
